# Social Network API

## Module 18 Challenge

### Description

This is an API for a social network. [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) is used for routing, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) is used for the database, and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) is used for object modelling.
